# 👋 Hi, I'm Ángel Encinas Moreno

I'm an aspiring researcher deeply passionate about fundamental physics. During my studies, I have developed passion for **astrophysics**, **particle physics**, and the fascinating world of **astroparticles and neutrinos**. This GitHub profile is my way of sharing the knowledge, tools, and code I've developed during my academic journey — including projects from my Master's degree and various research experiences.

I'm currently completing a Master's in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Granada, with a strong focus on aspects of theoretical and experimentalphysics(QFT,
Standard Model,neutrinos) and of corse, a stronge focus on astrophysics where I have my master thesis. At the same time, I’m exploring the intersection between cosmology and particle physics, aiming to contribute to the next generation of astroparticle experiments or astrophysics.
