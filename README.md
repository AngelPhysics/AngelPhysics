# 👋 Hi, I'm Ángel Encinas

I'm an aspiring researcher deeply passionate about **astrophysics**, **particle physics**, and especially the fascinating world of **astroparticles and neutrinos**. This GitHub profile is my way of sharing the knowledge, tools, and code I've developed during my academic journey — including projects from my Master's degree and various research experiences.

I'm currently completing a Master's in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Granada, with a strong focus on extragalactic astrophysics and observational techniques. At the same time, I’m exploring the intersection between cosmology and particle physics, aiming to contribute to the next generation of neutrino and astroparticle experiments.
